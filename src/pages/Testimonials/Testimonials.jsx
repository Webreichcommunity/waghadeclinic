        'I had a fantastic experience at Waghade Skin Clinic. Dr. Praful provided high standard care and professional counselling. The clinic was clean, hygienic, and well-equipped with sterilised equipment. The quick service, reasonable pricing, and speedy recovery made it even better. The clinic is easily accessible and well-connected. I didnâ€™t have to wait long for my appointment, and the in-house chemist and testing facilities were convenient for my routine check-up. Highly recommended!',
